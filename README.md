# EuroTruckSimulator2DedicatedServerSetup

A set of files required to set up a dedicated server for Euro Truck Simulator 2.

How to use this ?

First to all this will work only with Steam if you use anything else it will not work ! Any issues regarding that it dont work with game or server that is installed outside of Steam will be ignored ! There is no reason to use SteamCMD since you can add dedicated server to your Steam library.

1. Install dedicated server by clicking install on this website https://steamdb.info/app/1948160/

2. Download files from this respository and extract them to Euro Truck Simulator 2 folder (location depends on system).

3. Start dedicated server by clicking Start on steam. Server console windows should open.

Thats it !
